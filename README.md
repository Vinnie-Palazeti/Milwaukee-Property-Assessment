# Milwaukee-Property-Assessment

This paper examines the effect population demographics have on the assessment of homes in
Milwaukee, Wisconsin. We examine Milwaukee residential data from 2018 and 2019 joined with
American Community Survey 5 Year Estimates. We use hierarchical linear models (HLMs)
and multiple mixed logistic regression models to assess the effect population demographics
have on the assessment-to-sale ratio. We find that in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, assessment-to-sale
ratios in black and hispanic communities, controlling for home characteristics, decrease as their
respective populations increase. Further research into the relationship between income, race,
and ethnicity could help find a causal link for this difference.
